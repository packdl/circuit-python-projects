# Sight Words
This is a Circuit Python project using a PyGamer. It's basically using the [PyGamer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pygamer?gclid=CjwKCAjw7IeUBhBbEiwADhiEMbDUp9lv7Xw_-ILVV-wlQp6LLYdy-6o2Zoqk8Mkg1XhAH5BYs9jI2RoCfkQQAvD_BwE) as a flash card system and a color display system. Kids can learn their [sight words](https://www.weareteachers.com/what-are-sight-words/) and to distinguish colors. 

The A button on the PyGamer shows a sight word. The B button plays a WAV file. The select button and start buttons show a random color on the neopixels.
